# Naming

## Project

On GitHub, the project is named -microMiniwave. It should read Î¼Miniwave, but I had to spell it out and use the character, as non-ASCII characters are not supported in GitHub URI schemes at the moment.

## Kernel

The project will run on a modified version of the Linux kernel dubbed `the popcorn kernel` it is just a different name for the Linux kernel, it won't be too big as its own project. Specifically, it will be based on the fully open source Linux kernel fork that gets rid of all proprietary binary blobs (proprietary driver source code) and will be designed specifically to run on embedded systems.
